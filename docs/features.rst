Features
========

Here are the basic features of overreact, in no particular order.

Free energy corrections
-----------------------

overreact supports a series of correction factors for free energies such as:

- concentration corrections
- symmetry corrections

Equilibrium and reaction rate constants
---------------------------------------

overreact is capable of calculating reaction rate constants, including tunneling effects, from differences in free energy, as long as equilibrium constants for equilibria.

Microkinetics simulations
-------------------------

overreact can simulate reaction schemes over time in the fixed volume, well-stirred approximation.

Degree of rate control
----------------------

Degree of selectivity control
-----------------------------
