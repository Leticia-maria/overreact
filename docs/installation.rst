Installation
============

At the command line::

    pip install overreact
    pip install 'overreact[thermo]'

The last line installs `thermo` (https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) along
with `overreact`. `thermo` is used to calculate the dynamic viscosity of
solvents.

Dependencies
------------

``overreact`` depends only on ``scipy``. Optionally, extra functionality is
provided by ``thermo``.
