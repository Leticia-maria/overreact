**overreact** allows you to easily construct and analyze microkinetic models.
All data is parsed directly from logfiles thanks to `cclib <https://cclib.github.io/>`__.
Free energies calculated under the quasi-rigid rotor harmonic oscillator are
employed in the automatic prediction of reaction rate constants (including
tunneling effects). Reaction networks can be subsequently simulated over time.
